# Findtheerrors
Find the Errors - Each of the following programs has some errors. Find as many errors as you can, then create the appropriate program, execute it,
See Programs 1-3 for my answers 

1.       using namespace std;
             int main () 
            {    
                   double number1, number2, sum; 

                   Cout << "Enter a number: ";    
                   Cin << number1;    
                    Cout << "Enter another number: ";    
                    Cin << number2;     
                    number1 + number2 = sum;   
                    Cout "The sum of the two numbers is " << sum     
                    return 0; 
             }  


2.       #include <iostream> 
              using namespace std; 

              int main()  
              {     
                      int number1, number2;     
                      float quotient;     
                      cout << "Enter two numbers and I will divide\n";    
                      cout << "the first by the second for you.\n";     
                      cin >> number1, number2;    
                      quotient = float<static_cast>(number1) / number2;    
                      cout << quotient    
                      return 0;
               }     


3.       #include <iostream>; 
             using namespace std; 

             int main()
             {     
                   char name, go; 

                   cout << "Enter your name: ";    
                   getline >> name;     
                   cout << "Hi " << name << endl;
